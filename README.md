# Welcome to the Wasp repository!

[Wasp](https://github.com/iotaledger/wasp) is a node software developed by the
[IOTA Foundation](http://iota.org) to run the _IOTA Smart Contracts_
(_ISC_ in short) on top of the _IOTA Tangle_.  Here's a [high-level
introduction](https://blog.iota.org/an-introduction-to-iota-smart-contracts-16ea6f247936)
into ISC.

You can find a comprehensive overview of design decisions for _IOTA Smart Contracts_ in the
[ISC white paper](https://github.com/iotaledger/wasp/raw/master/documentation/ISC_WP_Nov_10_2021.pdf).
