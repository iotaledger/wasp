// This example implements 'fairroulette', a simple smart contract that can automatically handle
// an unlimited amount of bets on a number during a timed betting round. Once a betting round
// is over the contract will automatically pay out the winners proportionally to their bet amount.
// The intent is to showcase basic functionality of WasmLib and timed calling of functions
// through a minimal implementation and not to come up with a complete real-world solution.

// 'placeBet' is used by betters to place a bet on a number from 1 to MAX_NUMBER. The first
// incoming bet triggers a betting round of configurable duration. After the playing period
// expires the smart contract will automatically pay out any winners and start a new betting
// round upon arrival of a new bet.
// The 'placeBet' function takes 1 mandatory parameter:
// - 'number', which must be an Int64 number from 1 to MAX_NUMBER
// The 'member' function will save the number together with the address of the better and
// the amount of incoming iotas as the bet amount in its state.

	ctx.Require(amount > 0, "empty bet")

	// Now we gather all information together into a single serializable struct
	// Note that we use the caller() method of the function context to determine
	// the agent id of the better. This is where a potential pay-out will be sent.
	bet := &Bet{

		// And now for our next trick we post a delayed request to ourselves on the Tangle.
		// We are requesting to call the 'lockBets' function, but delay it for the play_period
		// amount of seconds. This will lock in the playing period, during which more bets can
		// be placed. Once the 'lockBets' function gets triggered by the ISCP it will gather all

// to get triggered by the ISCP at the correct time any other incoming bets are added to the "bets"
// array in state storage. Once the 'lockBets' function gets triggered it will move all bets to a
// second state storage array called "lockedBets", after which it will request the 'payWinners'

// and potentially calculating the winning value in advance the 'lockBets' function instead asks
// the 'payWinners' function to do this once the bets have been locked. This will generate a new
// transaction with completely unpredictable transaction hash. This hash is what we will use as
