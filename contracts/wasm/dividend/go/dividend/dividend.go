// This example implements 'dividend', a simple smart contract that will

// of member addresses according to predefined division factors. The intent is
// to showcase basic functionality of WasmLib through a minimal implementation
// and not to come up with a complete robust real-world solution.
// Note that we have drawn sometimes out constructs that could have been done
// in a single line over multiple statements to be able to properly document
// step by step what is happening in the code. We also unnecessarily annotate
// all 'var' statements with their assignment type to improve understanding.
