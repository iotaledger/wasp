// This example implements 'dividend', a simple smart contract that will
// automatically disperse iota tokens which are sent to the contract to a group
// of member accounts according to predefined division factors. The intent is
// to showcase basic functionality of WasmLib through a minimal implementation
// and not to come up with a complete robust real-world solution.
// Note that we have drawn sometimes out constructs that could have been done
// in a single line over multiple statements to be able to properly document
// step by step what is happening in the code. We also unnecessarily annotate
// all 'let' statements with their assignment type to improve understanding.

// use this information to prevent non-owners from calling certain functions.
// The 'init' function takes a single optional parameter:
// - 'owner', which is the agent id of the entity owning the contract.
// When this parameter is omitted the owner will default to the contract creator.
