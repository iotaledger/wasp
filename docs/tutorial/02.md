 ## Tokens and the UTXO Ledger

The Pollen release of the Goshimmer node implements the IOTA _UTXO Ledger_, a
distributed ledger of tokens. We won't go into the details of the UTXO Ledger.
The introduction of it can be found [here](../intro/utxo.md). We only have to
know that the UTXO Ledger contains balances of colored tokens locked in 
addresses, like this:

 ```
Address: Yk85765qdrwheQ4udj6RihxtPxudTSWF9qYe4NsAfp6K
    IOTA: 1000
    Red: 15
    Green: 200
```

where `IOTA` is the color code of IOTA tokens and `Red` and `Green` are other
color codes
([color codes are 32-byte hashes, as defined by Goshimmer](https://github.com/iotaledger/goshimmer/blob/87d0cbb172c1b3432b1dddcbabacd76cad66f1f3/dapps/valuetransfers/packages/balance/color.go#L10)).
Tokens can only be moved on the UTXO Ledger by unlocking the corresponding
address with its private key.

(In this tutorial we will use `private key`, `signature scheme` and `wallet` as
synonyms).

The `Solo` environment implements a detailed in-memory UTXO Ledger. For example,
you can only move tokens in the _Solo_ environment by creating and submitting
valid and signed transactions. You can also create new wallets on the UTXO 
Ledger and request iotas from the faucet to your wallet.

The following code shows how to do it:

```go
func TestTutorial2(t *testing.T) {
    env := solo.New(t, false, false)
    _, userAddress := env.NewKeyPairWithFunds() // create new wallet with 1337 iotas
    t.Logf("Address of the userWallet is: %s", userAddress)
    numIotas := env.GetAddressBalance(userAddress, ledgerstate.ColorIOTA) // how many iotas the address contains
    t.Logf("balance of the userWallet is: %d iota", numIotas)
    env.AssertAddressBalance(userAddress, ledgerstate.ColorIOTA, 1337) // assert the address has 1337 iotas
}
```

The output of the test:

```
=== RUN   TestTutorial2
43:03.822	INFO	TestTutorial2	solo/solo.go:140	Solo environment created with initial logical time 2021-04-27 12:43:03.8219457 -0700 PDT m=+0.003645301

        }
    tutorial_test.go:36: balance of the userWallet is: 1337 iota
--- PASS: TestTutorial2 (0.00s)
```

The UTXO Ledger in _Solo_ "lives" in the global environment `env` of the test.
It is shared among all chains, deployed on that environment. It serves as a
medium for transactions between smart contracts on different chains. This way
_Solo_ makes it possible to test transacting between chains.

Note that in the test above we didn’t deploy any chains: the UTXO Ledger exists
independent of any chains.
