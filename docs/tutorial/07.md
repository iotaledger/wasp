## Invoking smart contracts. Calling a view

The statement in the above example calls the view entry point `getString` of the
smart contract `example1` without parameters:

```go
res, err := chain.CallView("example1", "getString")
```

The call returns both a collection of key/value pairs `res` and an error result
`err` in typical Go fashion.

The basic principle of calling a view is similar to sending a request to the
smart contract. The essential difference is that calling a view does not 
constitute an asynchronous transaction, but is just a direct synchronous 
call to the view entry point function, exposed by the smart contract.

Therefore, calling a view doesn't involve any token transfers. Sending a
request (a transaction) to a view entry point will result in an exception. It
will return all attached tokens back to the sender (minus fees, if any).

Views are used to retrieve information about the state of the smart contract,
for example to display the information on a website. Certain _Solo_ methods such
as `chain.GetInfo`, `chain.GetFeeInfo` and `chain.GetTotalAssets` call views of
the core smart contracts behind scenes to retrieve the information about the
chain or a specific smart contract.

### Decoding results returned by _PostRequestSync_ and _CallView_

The following is a specific technicality of the Go environment of _Solo_.

The result returned by the call to an entry point from the _Solo_ environment
is in the form of key/value pairs, the `dict.Dict` type. It is an extended
interface and alias of `map[string][]byte`.
The [dict.Dict](https://github.com/iotaledger/wasp/blob/master/packages/kv/dict/dict.go)
package implements the `kv.KVStore` interface and provides a lot of useful 
functions to handle this form of key/value storage.

In normal operation of smart contracts one can only retrieve results returned by
view calls, since view calls are synchronous. Sending a request to a smart
contract is normally an asynchronous operation, and the caller cannot retrieve
the result. However, in the _Solo_ environment, the call to `PostRequestSync` is
synchronous, and the caller can inspect the result: this is a convenient
difference between the mocked _Solo_ environment, and the distributed UTXO
Ledger used by Wasp nodes. It can be used to make assertions about the results
of a call in the tests.

In the example `res` is a dictionary where keys and values are binary slices.
The statement

```go
returnedString, exists, err := codec.DecodeString(res.MustGet("paramString"))
```

takes the value of the key `paramString` from the key value store and attempts
to decode it as a `string`. The decoding returns a possible error value,
existence flag and the value itself.
