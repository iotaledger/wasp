# Tokens and the UTXO Ledger

The Nectar release of the GoShimmer node implements the IOTA _UTXO Ledger_, a
distributed ledger of tokens. We won't go into the details of the UTXO Ledger.
The specification of the _UTXO Ledger_ can be found [here](https://goshimmer.docs.iota.org/docs/protocol_specification/ledgerstate/).
We only have to know that the _UTXO Ledger_ contains balances of colored tokens locked in
addresses, like this:

```log
Address: Yk85765qdrwheQ4udj6RihxtPxudTSWF9qYe4NsAfp6K
    IOTA: 1000
    Red: 15
    Green: 200
```

where `IOTA` is the color code of IOTA tokens and `Red` and `Green` are other
color codes (color codes are 32-byte hashes, as defined by Goshimmer).
Tokens can only be moved on the UTXO Ledger by unlocking the corresponding
address with its private key.

(In this tutorial we will use `private key`, `signature scheme` and `wallet` as
synonyms).

The `Solo` environment implements a detailed in-memory _UTXO Ledger_. For example,
you can only move tokens in the _Solo_ environment by creating and submitting
valid and signed transactions. You can also create new wallets on the _UTXO
Ledger_ and request iotas from the faucet to your wallet.

The following code shows how to do it:

```go
func TestTutorial2(t *testing.T) {
	env := solo.New(t, false, false, seed)
	_, userAddress := env.NewKeyPairWithFunds(env.NewSeedFromIndex(1))
	t.Logf("address of the userWallet is: %s", userAddress.Base58())
	numIotas := env.GetAddressBalance(userAddress, colored.IOTA) // how many iotas the address contains
	t.Logf("balance of the userWallet is: %d iota", numIotas)
	env.AssertAddressBalance(userAddress, colored.IOTA, utxodb.FundsFromFaucetAmount)
}
```

The deterministic output of the test:

```
=== RUN   TestTutorial2
53:47.437253000	INFO	TestTutorial2.db	dbmanager/dbmanager.go:54	creating new registry database. Persistent: false

    tutorial_test.go:41: balance of the userWallet is: 1000000 iota
--- PASS: TestTutorial2 (0.00s)
```

The UTXO Ledger in _Solo_ "lives" in the global environment `env` of the test.
It is shared among all chains, which are deployed on that environment. It serves as a
medium for transactions between smart contracts on different chains. This way
_Solo_ makes it possible to test transacting between chains.

Note that in the test above we didn’t deploy any chains: the UTXO Ledger exists
independently of any chains.
