# Structure of the smart contract

Smart contracts are programs, immutably stored in the chain. In the previous
example the binary file with the code of the smart contract
_example_tutorial_bg.wasm_ will be immutably stored in the chain state.

The logical structure of an ISCP smart contract is independent of the VM type we
use, be it a _Wasm_ smart contract or any other VM type.

![Smart Contract Structure](/img/tutorial/SC-structure.png)

Each smart contract on the chain is identified by its name hashed into 4 bytes
and interpreted as `uint32` value: the so called `hname`. For example,
the `hname` of the root contract is `0xcebf5908`, the unique identifier of the
`root` contract in every chain. The exception is `_default` contract which always has hname `0x00000000`.

Each smart contract instance has a program with a collection of entry points and
a state. An entry point is a function of the program through which the program
can be invoked. The `example1` contract above has three entry
points: `storeString`, `getString` and `withdrawIota`.

There are several ways to invoke an entry point: a request, a call and a view
call, depending on the type of the entry point.

The smart contract program can access its state and account through an interface
layer called the _Sandbox_.

## State

The smart contract state is its data, with each update stored on the chain. The
state can only be modified by the smart contract program itself. There are two
parts of the state:

- A collection of key/value pairs called the `data state`. Each key and value
  are byte arrays of arbitrary size (there are practical limits set by the
  database, of course). The value of the key/value pair is always retrieved by
  its key.
- A collection of `color: balance` pairs called the `account`. The account
  represents the balances of tokens of specific colors controlled by the smart
  contract. Receiving and spending tokens into/from the account means changing
  the account's balances.

Only the smart contract program can change its data state and spend from its
account. Tokens can be sent to the smart contract account by any other agent on
the ledger, be it a wallet with an address or another smart contract.

See [Accounts](../guide/core_concepts/core_contracts/accounts.md) for more info on sending and receiving tokens.

## Entry points

There are two types of entry points:

- _Full entry points_ or just _entry points_. These functions can modify
  (mutate) the state of the smart contract.
- _View entry points_ or _views_. These are read-only functions. They are used
  only to retrieve the information from the smart contract state. They can’t
  modify the state, i.e. are read-only calls.

The `example1` program has three entry points:

- `storeString` a full entry point. It first checks if parameter
  called `paramString` exist. If so, it stores the string value of the parameter
  into the state variable `storedString`. If parameter `paramString` is missing,
  the program panics.

- `getString` is a view entry point that returns the value of the
  variable `storedString`.

- `withdrawIota` is a full entry point that checks if the caller is and address
  and if the caller is equal to the creator of smart contract. If not, it
  panics. If it passes the validation, the program sends all the iotas contained
  in the smart contract's account to the caller.

Note that in the `example1` the Rust functions associated with full entry points
take a parameter of type `ScFuncContext`. It gives full (read-write) access to
the state. In contrast, `getString` is a view entry point and its associated
function parameter has type `ScViewContext`. A view is not allowed to mutate 
the state.

## Panic. Exception handling

The following test posts a request to the `example1` smart contract without 
the expected parameter `paramString`. The
statement `ctx.require(par.exists(), "string parameter not found");` makes 
the smart contract panic if the condition is not satisfied.

```go
func TestTutorial4(t *testing.T) {
	env := solo.New(t, false, false, seed)

	chain := env.NewChain(nil, "ex4")
	// deploy the contract on chain
	err := chain.DeployWasmContract(nil, "example1", "example_tutorial_bg.wasm")
	require.NoError(t, err)

	// call contract incorrectly (omit 'paramString')
	req := solo.NewCallParams("example1", "storeString").WithIotas(1)
	_, err = chain.PostRequestSync(req, nil)
	require.Error(t, err)
}
```

The fragments in the output of the test:

```
37:34.189474700	PANIC	TestTutorial4.ex4	vmcontext/log.go:12	string parameter not found

37:34.192828900	INFO	TestTutorial4.ex4	solo/run.go:148	REQ: 'tx/[0]9r5zoeusdwTcWkDTEMYjeqNj8reiUsLiHF81vExPrvNW: 'panic in VM: string parameter not found''
``` 

It shows that the panic indeed occurred. The test passes because the resulting
error was expected.

The log record
```
37:34.192828900	INFO	TestTutorial4.ex4	solo/run.go:148	REQ: 'tx/[0]9r5zoeusdwTcWkDTEMYjeqNj8reiUsLiHF81vExPrvNW: 'panic in VM: string parameter not found''
```
is a printed receipt of the request. It is stored on the chain for each request processed.

Note that this test ends with the state `#4`, despite the fact that the last
request to the smart contract failed. This is important: **whatever happens
during the execution of a smart contract's full entry point, processing of the 
request always results in the state transition**.

The VM context catches exceptions (panics) in the program. Its consequences are
recorded in the state of the chain during the fallback processing, no matter if
the panic was triggered by the logic of the smart contract or whether it was 
triggered by the sandbox run-time code.

In the case of `example1` the error event was recorded in the immutable record
log of the chain, aka `receipt`, but the data state of the smart contract wasn't modified. In
other cases the fallback actions may be more complex.
