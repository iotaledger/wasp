# Testing Smart Contracts

Testing of smart contracts happens in the [Solo](../solo/what-is-solo.md) testing
environment. This enables synchronous, deterministic testing of smart contract
functionalities without the overhead of having to start nodes, set up a committee, and
send transactions over the Tangle. Instead, you can use Go's built-in test environment in
combination with Solo to deploy chains and smart contracts and simulate transactions.

Solo directly interacts with the ISC code, and therfore uses all the ISC-specific data
types directly. Our Wasm smart contracts cannot access these types directly, because they
run in a separate, sandboxed environment. Therefore, WasmLib implements its
[own versions](types.mdx) of these data types, and the VM layer acts as a data type
translator between both systems.

The impact of this type transformation used to be that to be able to write tests in the
solo environment the user also needed to know about the ISC-specific data types and type
conversion functions, and exactly how to properly pass such data in and out of smart
contract function calls. This burdened the user with an unnecessary increased learning
curve and countless unnecessary type conversions.

With the introduction of the [Schema Tool](usage.mdx), we were able to remove this
impedance mismatch and allow the users to test smart contract functionality in terms of
the WasmLib data types and functions that they are already familiar with. To that end, we
introduced `SoloContext`, a new [Call Context](context.mdx) that specifically works with
the Solo testing environment. We aimed to simplify the testing of smart contracts as much
as possible, keeping the full Solo interface hidden as much as possible, but still
available when necessary.

The only concession we still have to make is to the language used. Because Solo only works
in the Go language environment, we have to use the Go language version of the interface
code that the schema tool generates when testing our smart contracts. Because WasmLib
programming for Go, Rust, and TypeScript are practically identical, we feel that this is
not unsurmountable. The WasmLib interfaces only differ slightly if language idiosyncrasies
force differences in syntax or naming conventions. This hurdle used to be a lot bigger,
when direct programming of Solo had to be used, and most type conversions had to be done
manually. Now we get to use the generated compile-time type-checked interface to our smart
contract functions that we are already familiar with.

Let's look at the simplest way of initializing a smart contract by using the new
`SoloContext` in a test function:

<Tabs defaultValue="go"
      values={[
          {label: 'Go', value: 'go'},
      ]}>

<TabItem value="go">

```go
func TestDeploy(t *testing.T) {
    ctx := wasmsolo.NewSoloContext(t, dividend.ScName, dividend.OnLoad)
    require.NoError(t, ctx.ContractExists(dividend.ScName))
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The first line will automatically create a new chain, and upload and deploy the provided
example `dividend` contract to this chain. It returns a `SoloContext` for further use. The
second line verifies the existence of the deployed contract on the chain associated with
that call context.

Here is another part of the `dividend` test code, where you can see how we wrap repetitive
calls to smart contract functions that are used in multiple tests:

<Tabs defaultValue="go"
      values={[
          {label: 'Go', value: 'go'},
      ]}>

<TabItem value="go">

```go
func dividendMember(ctx *wasmsolo.SoloContext, agent *wasmsolo.SoloAgent, factor uint64) {
    member := dividend.ScFuncs.Member(ctx)
    member.Params.Address().SetValue(agent.ScAgentID().Address())
    member.Params.Factor().SetValue(factor)
    member.Func.Post()
}

func dividendDivide(ctx *wasmsolo.SoloContext, amount uint64) {
    divide := dividend.ScFuncs.Divide(ctx)
    divide.Func.TransferBaseTokens(amount).Post()
}

func dividendGetFactor(ctx *wasmsolo.SoloContext, member *wasmsolo.SoloAgent) uint64 {
    getFactor := dividend.ScFuncs.GetFactor(ctx)
    getFactor.Params.Address().SetValue(member.ScAgentID().Address())
    getFactor.Func.Call()
    value := getFactor.Results.Factor().Value()
    return value
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

As you can see, we pass the `SoloContext` and the parameters to the wrapper functions,
then use the `SoloContext` to create a [Function Descriptor](funcdesc.mdx) for the
wrapped function, pass any parameters through the its `Params` proxy, and then either
[post()](post.mdx) the function request or [call()](call.mdx) the function. Any results
returned are extracted through the descriptor's `Results` proxy, and returned by the
wrapper function.

There is hardly any difference in the way the function interface is used within Wasm code
or within Solo test code. The call context knows how to properly call() or post() the
function call through the function descriptor. This makes for seamless testing of smart
contracts.

In the [next section](examples.mdx) we will go deeper into how the helper member functions
of the SoloContext are used to simplify tests.
