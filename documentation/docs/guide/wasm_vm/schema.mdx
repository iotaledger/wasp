# Smart Contract Schema Tool

Smart contracts need to be very robust. The generic nature of WasmLib allows for a lot of
flexibility, but it also provides a lot of opportunities to make mistakes. In addition,
there is a lot of repetitive coding involved in creating smart contracts. The setup code
that is needed for every smart contract must follow strict rules. You also want to assure
that certain functions can only be called by specific entities. You need to verify that
mandatory function parameter values are present. And function parameter values and return
values need to be converted between their binary representation and their actual data
type in a consistent way.

The best way to increase robustness is by using a code generator that will take care of
most repetitive coding tasks. A code generator only needs to be debugged once, after which
the generated code is 100% accurate and trustworthy. Another advantage of code generation
is that you can regenerate code to correctly reflect any changes to the smart contract
interface. A code generator can also help you by generating wrapper code that limits what
you can do to mirror the intent behind it. This enables compile-time enforcing of some
aspects of the defined smart contract behavior. A code generator can also support multiple
different programming languages.

During the initial experiences with creating demo smart contracts for WasmLib, we quickly
identified a number of areas where there was a lot of repetitive coding going on. Some
examples of repetition were:

* Setting up the `on_load` function and keeping it up to date
* Checking function access rights
* Verifying function parameter types
* Verifying the presence of mandatory function parameters
* Setting up access to [State](state.mdx), [Params](params.mdx), and [Results](results.mdx) maps
* Defining common strings as constants

To facilitate the code generation, it was decided to use a _schema definition file_ for
smart contracts. The aspects of a smart contract that should be known by someone who wants
to use the contract are all clearly defined in a schema definition file. This schema
definition file then becomes the single source of truth for the interface to the smart
contract. This schema definition file is then used by our [Schema Tool](usage.mdx) to
automatically generate a complete smart contract skeleton that reflects the schema
definition and only needs to be augmented by providing the actual function
implementations.

The schema definition file defines things like the [state storage](state.mdx) variables
that the smart contract uses, the [Funcs](funcs.mdx) and [Views](views.mdx) that the
contract implements, the [access rights](access.mdx) for each function, the
[input parameters](params.mdx) and [output results](results.mdx) for each function, and
additional data structures that the contract uses.

With detailed schema information readily available in a single location, it becomes
possible to do a lot more than just generating repetitive code fragments. You can use the
schema information to generate the interfaces to functions, and have parameters, results,
and state variables that use strict compile-time type-checking. That removes a common
source of accidental errors. The generated interface can also be used by client side code
so that there is a single, consistent way of calling smart contract functions.

Another advantage of knowing everything about important smart contract aspects is that it
is possible to generate constants to prevent repeating of typo-prone key strings, and
precalculate necessary values like Hnames and encode them as constants instead of having
the code recalculate them every time they are needed.

Similarly, since you know all static keys that are going to be used by the smart contract
in advance, you can now generate code that will inform the host correctly about all Funcs
and Views that are available in the smart contract.

Because of all this the code becomes both simpler and more efficient. Note that all the
improvements described above are independent of the actual programming language that is
being generated.

The schema definition file can also provide a starting point for other tooling, for
example a tool that automatically audits a smart contract.


In the next section we will look at how the [Schema Tool](usage.mdx) works.
