# Spec

## Workflow

1. YAML file would be converted to a tree of `wasp_yaml.Node`
2. Convert the tree to a `model.SchemaDef` object
3. Compile the `model.SchemaDef` object to `model.Schema` object by calling `Compile()`
4. Convert `model.Schema` object to the Smart Contract of targeting languages

## Types

### model.SchemaDef

`model.SchemaDef` is a intermediate object during the Smart Contract generation. An YAML file will be converted to `model.SchemaDef` object.
During the conversion, each YAML attribute except the top-level ones (`name`, `description`, `events`, `structs`, `typedefs`, `state`, `funcs`, `views`) will be converted into `DefElt`.

Therefore, for YAML tags `name`, `description`, the values of them will be converted into 2 independent `DefElt`.

```
name: TestName
description: This is test description
```

For keywords that can have multiple values can be seen as either a one layer map (i.e., `typedefs` and `state`) 
or two layer map (i.e., `typedefs` and `state`). A one layer map will be converted into  `DefMap` which 
is a map whose key and value are both `DefElt`. And a two layer map will be converted into  `DefMapMap` which 
is a map whose key is `DefElt` and value is `DefMap`.

The definition of `DefElt` is shown as following,

```go
type DefElt struct {
	Val     string
	Comment string
	Line    int
}
```

It contains the raw value of the YAML attributes (without extracting the information), the comment belongs to the 
YAML attribute, and the line number of the YAML attribute.

Here is an example of one layer map

```yaml
typedefs:
  TestTypedef1: String
  TestTypedef2: String
state:
  TestState1: Int64[]
  TestState2: Int64[]
```

And an example of two layer map

```yaml
structs:
  point:
    x: Int32
    y: Int32
funcs:
  testFunc:
    params:
      testFuncParam: Uint64
    results:
      testFuncResult: Uint64
views:
  testView:
    params:
      testViewParam: Uint64
    results:
      testViewResult: Uint64
```

Next, schema tool will set each fields in `SchemaDef` variable.

```go
type SchemaDef struct {
	Copyright   string
	Name        DefElt
	Description DefElt
	Events      DefMapMap
	Structs     DefMapMap
	Typedefs    DefMap
	State       DefMap
	Funcs       FuncDefMap
	Views       FuncDefMap
}
```

### model.Schema

By calling `Schema.Compile()`, `model.SchemaDef` object will be compiled into `model.Schema`. 
During the compilation, schema tool will extract the rules from the YAML attributes.

Here is the definition of a `Schema` object.

```go
type Schema struct {
	ContractName  string
	Copyright     string
	PackageName   string
	Description   string
	CoreContracts bool
	SchemaTime    time.Time
	Events        []*Struct
	Funcs         []*Func
	Params        []*Field
	Results       []*Field
	StateVars     []*Field
	Structs       []*Struct
	Typedefs      []*Field
}
```

And let's take a close look at `Field` object.

```go
type Field struct {
	Name       string // external name for this field
	Alias      string // internal name alias, can be different from Name
	Array      bool
	FldComment string
	MapKey     string
	Optional   bool
	Type       string
	BaseType   bool
	Comment    string
	Line       int // the line number originally in yaml/json file
}
```

As you can see `typedefs` was a simple `DefMap`, which consists a map whose key and value are both `DefElt`, 
and `DefElt` a simple object contains only raw string of the YAML attribute, comment and line number.
However, after the compilation, information is extracted from the raw string, so do some checks are conducted in this step.

### Compile

An emitter is used for filling corresponding values into templates under `tools/schema/generator`.
For how to do meta-programming with emitter, see section [Emitter](#Emitter)

```go
type (
	FieldMap       map[string]*Field
	FieldMapMap    map[string]FieldMap
	StringMap      map[string]string
	StringMapMap   map[string]StringMap
)
```

## Comments

### Header Comment and Line Comment

Header comment has higher priority than the line comment. If there are both header comment and line comment presented at
same YAML attribute, then schema tool will keep only the header comment.

### Comment Block

A comment block is a chunk of comment that doesn't have a line break to separate it. Schema tool would take the 
header comment that immediately followed by the YAML attribute or the line comment block if header comment block is not
presented.

Therefore, for the following case

```yaml
typedefs:
  # header comment 1
  # header comment 2

  # header comment 3
  # header comment 4
  TestTypedef: String # line comment 1
                      # line comment 2
```

only these 2 lines 

```yaml
# header comment 3
# header comment 4
```

will be kept and presented in the final Smart Contract.

And the next case 

```yaml
typedefs:
  TestTypedef: String # line comment 1
                      # line comment 2

                      # line comment 3
                      # line comment 4
```

only these 2 lines 

```yaml
# line comment 1
# line comment 2
```

will be kept and presented in the final Smart Contract.

## Emitter

### Access Keys

With `$` prepending a key (keys are set in `GenBase.setCommonKeys()`, `GenBase.setFieldKeys()`, `GenBase.setFuncKeys()`),  schema tool can access the value of the key in `GenBase.keys` according to the current context. For example, if you want to access lower case package name, you can access it with `$package`.
To dynamically add a new key in templates (under gotemplates, rstemplates, and tstemplates), you can call `$#set` instruction, see section [set](#set) for more information.

### Key And Plain String Concatenation

To concatenate a value from accessing key and a plain string, you should use `$+` operator. 
For example, here `FuncName` is a key that preserves the name of the function under current context, and we want to concatenate the function name with "Mutable" and "Results".
In other words, we want to do the same task as the following python code and get the result in `result` variable.

```python
func_name = "..." # function name under current context
result = "Mutable" + func_name + "Results" # concatenate the strings into the result
```

In the schema template language, we should call `Mutable$FuncName$+Results`.

### Instructions

Keywords follows `$#` are the instructions defined in our schema template language. One thing you should aware, now, all the instruction should be presented at the beginning of each line. In other words, no spaces and characters are allowed to exist ahead of an instruction.
Here is the list of all the instruction keywords.

* emit
* each
* func
* if
* set

We are going to introduce how to use each instruction as follows. Or you can check the implementation of `GenBase.emit()` to know how are they implemented in detailed.

#### emit

`emit` is using for expanding templates. The syntax of `emit` instruction is 

```
$#emit template
```

Here, `template` is any template which defined under gotemplates,rstemplates).
Templates are defined in `model.StringMap`. In the instruction call of `emit` just simply use the name of the template (the key in `model.StringMap`).
If you want to insert the `copyright` template to a assigned location, then you should call 

```
$#emit copyright
```

#### each

`each` processes the template for each item in the array. The syntax of `each` instruction is

```
$#each array template
```

Here `array` is either a predefined keyword (we are going to introduce each of them as follow) or a multi-lines string.
If a multi-lines string is presented, then the multi-lines string will be expanded and append newline escape character of targeting languages in the end of each line.

##### event

Iterate the fields in a event.

##### events

Iterate all the `events` in the contract.

##### func

Iterate all the `funcs` in the contract.

##### mandatory

Iterate all the mandatory fields in the current processed function. The mandatory field must be basetype and not an array or a map.

##### param

Iterate all the `params` fields in the current processed function.

##### params

Iterate all the `params` fields in the current contract.

##### result

Iterate all the `results` fields in the current processed function.

##### results

Iterate all the `results` fields in the current contract.

##### state

Iterate all the `state` in the contract.

##### struct

Iterate the fields in a struct.

##### structs

Iterate all the `structs` in the contract.

##### typedef

Iterate all the typedefs in the contract.

#### func

Currently not used.

#### if

The syntax of `if` is 

```
$#if condition template [elseTemplate]
```

`if` processes template when the named condition is true, and it processes the optional `elseTemplate` when the named condition is false

`condition` is either the predefined conditions (explained as following) or a key that may exist in `keys`.
If a key is presented, then `if` instruction would be used for check whether this key exists in `keys` or not. If the key exists, then `if` will return true, otherwise it will return false.

And here are the predefined conditions.

##### array

Is the current processed field an array?

##### basetype

Is the current processed field in basetype? `basetype`s are defined in the map `FieldTypes` in `tools/schema/model/field.go`.

##### core

Is the current processed contract a core contract?

##### event

Does the current processed event have any field?

##### events

Is there any event in the current processed contract?

##### exist

Does the value of key `proxy` exist?

##### func

Is the current processed function a `func` or a `view`? Return true if it is a `func`.

##### funcs

Is there any function in the current processed contract?

##### init

Is the current function an init function? An init function will automatically be called immediately after the first time the contract has been deployed to the VM.

##### mandatory

Is current field a mandatory field?

##### map

Is current processed field a map (check if the `currentField.MapKey` is empty)?

##### mut

Is the value in key `mut` Mutable?

##### param

Does the current processed function have any parameter?

##### params

Does the current contract have any `params` field?

##### ptrs

Does the current processed function have either `params` or `results`. This is used for implementing function object in Rust and TypeScript.

##### result

Does the current processed function have any return value?

##### results

Does the current contract have any `results` field?

##### state

Does the current contract have any `state` field?

##### structs

Does the current contract have any `structs` field?

##### this

Is the alias name of the current processed field `this`?

##### typedef

Is the current processed field a `typedef`?

##### typedefs

Does the current contract have any `typedefs` field?

##### view

Is the current processed function a `view` or a `func`? Return true if it is a `view`.

##### else

If you want to process a template under negate condition, then you can call

```
$#if condition else elseTemplate
```

Here `else` is a predefined empty template, which is defined at[`tools/schema/generator/templates.go`.

#### set

`set` is used for To dynamically specify a value to a certain key. The syntax is

```
$#set key value
```

For example, if you want to dynamically add a new key `initFunc` with the value in key `nil` you can call 

```
$#set initFunc $nil
```

A special key `exist` is used to add a newly generated type.
