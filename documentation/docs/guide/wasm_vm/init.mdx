# Smart Contract Initialization

Smart contracts start out with a completely blank state. Sometimes you may want to be able
to define initial state, for example if your contract is configurable. You may want to be
able to pass this configuration to the contract upon deployment, so that its state
reflects that configuration once the first request comes in. Such initialization can be
provided through an optional function named `init()`.

When provided, the `init()` function will automatically be called immediately after the
first time the contract has been deployed to the VM. Note that this is a one-time
initialization call, meant to be performed by the contract deployment mechanism. ISC will
prevent anyone else from calling this function ever again. So if you need to be able to
reconfigure the contract later on, you will need to provide a separate configuration
function, and guard it from being accessed by anyone else than properly authorized
entities.

To show how creating a smart contract with WasmLib works, we will slowly start fleshing
out the smart contract functions of the `dividend` example in this tutorial. Here is the
first part of the Rust code that implements it, which contains the `init()` function:

          {label: 'TypeScript', value: 'ts'},
      ]}>

// This example implements 'dividend', a simple smart contract that will
// automatically disperse iota tokens which are sent to the contract to a group

	if f.Params.Owner().Exists() {
		// Yes, it was present, so now we overwrite the default owner with
		// the one specified by the 'owner' parameter.
		owner = f.Params.Owner().Value()
	}

We define an owner variable and allow it to be something other than the default value of
contract creator. It is always a good idea to be flexible enough to be able to transfer
ownership to another entity if necessary. Remember that once a smart contract has been
deployed it is no longer possible to change it. Therefore, it is good practice thinking
through situations that could require change in advance, and allow the contract itself to
handle such changes through its state by providing a proper function interface:

Note that we only define a single owner here. Proper fall-back could require multiple
owners in case the owner entity could disappear, which would allow others to take over
instead of the contract becoming immutable with regard to owner functionality. Again, we
cannot stress enough how important it is to **think through every aspect of a smart
contract before deployment**.

In the next section we will look at how a smart contract can
[transfer tokens](transfers.mdx).
