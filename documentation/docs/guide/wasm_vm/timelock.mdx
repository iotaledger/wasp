# Colored Tokens and Time Locks

Let's examine some less commonly used member functions of the SoloContext. We will switch
to the `fairauction` example to show their usage. Here is the `startAuction()` function of
the `fairauction` test suite:

<Tabs defaultValue="go"
      values={[
          {label: 'Go', value: 'go'},
      ]}>

<TabItem value="go">

```go
const (
    description = "Cool NFTs for sale!"
    deposit     = uint64(1000)
    minBid      = uint64(500)
)

func startAuction(t *testing.T) (*wasmsolo.SoloContext, *wasmsolo.SoloAgent, wasmtypes.ScNftID) {
    ctx := wasmsolo.NewSoloContext(t, fairauction.ScName, fairauction.OnLoad)
    auctioneer := ctx.NewSoloAgent()
    nftID := ctx.MintNFT(auctioneer, []byte("NFT metadata"))
    require.NoError(t, ctx.Err)

    // start the auction
    sa := fairauction.ScFuncs.StartAuction(ctx.Sign(auctioneer))
    sa.Params.MinimumBid().SetValue(minBid)
    sa.Params.Description().SetValue(description)
    transfer := wasmlib.NewScTransferBaseTokens(deposit) // deposit, must be >=minimum*margin
    transfer.AddNFT(&nftID)
    sa.Func.Transfer(transfer).Post()
    require.NoError(t, ctx.Err)

    return ctx, auctioneer, nftID
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The function first sets up the SoloContext as usual, and then it performs quite a bit of
extra work. This is because we want the startAuction() function to start an auction, so
that the tests that subsequently use startAuction() can then focus on testing all kinds of
bidding and auction results.

First, we are going to need an agent that functions as the `auctioneer`. This auctioneer
will auction off an NFT. To provide the auctioneer with this NFT we use the `MintNFT()`
method to mint a fresh NFT into his account. The minting process will assign a unique NFT
ID. Of course, we check that no error occurred during the minting process.

Now we are going to start the auction by calling the `startAuction` function of the
`fairauction` contract. We get the function descriptor in the usual way, but we also call
the `Sign()` method of the SoloContext to make sure that the transaction we are about to
post takes its assets from the auctioneer address, and the transaction will be signed with
the corresponding private key. Very often you won't care who posts a request, and we have
set it up in such a way that by default tokens come from the chain originator address,
which has been seeded with tokens just for this occasion. But whenever it is important
where the tokens come from, or who invokes the request, you need to specify the agent
involved by using the Sign() method.

Next we set up the function parameters as usual. After the parameters have been set up, we
see something new happening. We create an `ScTransfer` proxy and initialize it with the
base tokens that we need to deposit, plus the freshly minted NFT that we are auctioning.
Next we use the `Transfer()` method to pass this proxy before posting the request. This is
exactly how we would do it from within the smart contract code. Note that the function
`NewScTransferBaseTokens()` is used as a shorthand to immediately initialize the new
`ScTransfer` proxy with the desired amount of base tokens.

Finally, we make sure there was no error after posting the request and return the
SoloContext, `auctioneer` and `nftID`. That concludes the startAuction() function.

Here is the first test function that uses our startAuction() function:

<Tabs defaultValue="go"
      values={[
          {label: 'Go', value: 'go'},
      ]}>

<TabItem value="go">

```go
func TestStartAuction(t *testing.T) {
    ctx, auctioneer, nftID := startAuction(t)

    nfts := ctx.Chain.L2NFTs(auctioneer.AgentID())
    require.Len(t, nfts, 0)
    nfts = ctx.Chain.L2NFTs(ctx.Account().AgentID())
    require.Len(t, nfts, 1)
    require.Equal(t, nftID, ctx.Cvt.ScNftID(&nfts[0]))

    // remove pending finalize_auction from backlog
    ctx.AdvanceClockBy(61 * time.Minute)
    require.True(t, ctx.WaitForPendingRequests(1))
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

This test function checks that the NFT was moved by `startAuction` from the auctioneer's
on-chain account to the chain's on-chain account.

The `startAuction` function of the smart contract will also have posted a time-locked
request to the `finalizeAuction` function by using the `Delay()` method. Therefore, we
need to remove the pending `finalizeAuction` request from the backlog.

First we move the logical clock forward to a point in time when that request is supposed
to have been triggered. Then we wait for this request to actually be processed. Note that
this will happen in a separate goroutine in the background, so we explicitly wait for the
request counters to catch up with the one request that is pending.

The `WaitForPendingRequests()` method can also be used whenever a smart contract function
is known to [`post()`](post.mdx) a request to itself. Such requests are not immediately
executed, but added to the backlog, so you need to wait for these pending requests to
actually be processed. The advantage of having to explicitly wait for those requests is
that you can inspect the in-between state, which means that you can test even a function
that posts a request in isolation.
