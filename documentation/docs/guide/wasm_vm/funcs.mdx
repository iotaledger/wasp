# Function Definitions

Here is the full schema definition file for the `dividend` example. We will now focus on
its `funcs` and `views` sections. Since they are structured identically we will only need
to explain the layout of these sections once.

<Tabs defaultValue="yaml"
    values={[
        {label: 'schema.yaml', value: 'yaml'},
    ]}>
<TabItem value="yaml">

```yaml
name: Dividend
description: Simple dividend smart contract
structs: {}
typedefs: {}
state:
  memberList: Address[] # array with all the recipients of this dividend

  # factors per member

  members: map[Address]Uint64 # map with all the recipient factors of this dividend
  owner: AgentID # owner of contract, the only one who can call 'member' func
  totalFactor: Uint64 # sum of all recipient factors
funcs:
  # divide tokens over members
  divide: {}
  init:
    params:
      owner: AgentID? # optional owner of contract, defaults to contract creator
  member:
    access: owner # only defined owner of contract can add members
    params:
      address: Address # address of dividend recipient
      factor: Uint64 # relative division factor
  setOwner:
    access: owner # only defined owner of contract can change owner
    params:
      owner: AgentID # new owner of smart contract
views:
  getFactor:
    params:
      address: Address # address of dividend recipient
    results:
      factor: Uint64 # relative division factor
  getOwner:
    results:
      owner: AgentID # current owner of this smart contract
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

As you can see each of the `funcs` and `views` sections defines their functions in the
same way. The only resulting difference is in the way the schema tool generates code for
them. The code generated for Funcs will be able to inspect and modify the smart contract
state, whereas the code generated for Views will only be able to inspect the state.

Functions are defined as named subsections in the schema definition file. The name of the
subsection will become the name of the function. In turn, there can be 3 optional
subsections under each function subsection.

* `access` indicates who is allowed to access the function.
* `params` holds the field definitions that describe the function parameters.
* `results` holds the field definitions that describe the function results.

We will now examine each subsection in more detail. In the next section we will first look
at the [`access`](access.mdx) subsection.
