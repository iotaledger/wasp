# ISC Architecture

IOTA Smart Contracts work as a _layer 2_ (L2 for short) extension of the [_IOTA Multi-Asset Ledger_](https://github.com/lzpap/tips/blob/master/tips/TIP-0018/tip-0018.md) (Layer 1, or L1 for short, also sometimes called the UTXO Ledger).

In IOTA Smart Contracts, each L2 chain has its own state and smart contracts that cause this state to change.
As validator nodes execute the smart contracts, they tally these state changes and write them into the chain.
Each time they update the state, they collectively agree on a new state and commit to it by publishing its hash to L1.

Each Layer 2 chain is functionally equivalent to, say, an Ethereum blockchain.
However, ISC chains can communicate with Layer 1 and each other, making ISC a more sophisticated protocol.
