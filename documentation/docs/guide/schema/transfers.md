# Token Transfers

There are two methods in the ISCP function context that deal with token balances. The
first one is the `balances()` method, which can be used to determine the current total
balance per token color that is governed by the smart contract. The second one is
the `incoming()` method, which can be used to determine the amounts of incoming tokens per
token color that were sent with the request to call the smart contract function.

Both methods provide access to zero or more balances of tokens, each for a different token
color, through a special `ScBalances` map proxy. Note that the incoming() balances are
provided to the smart contract function as if they have already been deposited in the
smart contract's account, but if any error occurs which causes the function to panic these
incoming() tokens will be returned to where they came from, and it will be as if they were
never sent to the smart contract.

There's also a `transfer_to_address()` method in the ISCP function context that can
transfer tokens from the smart contract account to any Tangle address. The tokens to be
transferred are provided to the method through a special `ScTransfers` map proxy. We will
be using the transfer_to_address() method in the dividend example to disperse the incoming
tokens to the member addresses.

The idea behind the dividend smart contract is that once we have set up the list of
members, consisting of address/factor pairs, and knowing the total sum of the factors, we
can automatically pay out a dividend to each of the members in the list according to the
factors involved. Whatever amount of tokens gets sent to the `divide` function will be
divided over the members in proportion based on their respective factors. For example, you
could set it up that address A has a factor 50, B has 30, and C has 20, for a total of 100
to divide. Then whenever an amount of tokens gets sent to the 'divide' function, address A
will receive 50/100th, address B will receive 30/100th, and address C will receive
20/100th of that amount.

Here is the `divide` function:

```go
// 'divide' is a function that will take any iotas it receives and properly
// disperse them to the addresses in the member list according to the dispersion
// factors associated with these addresses.
// Anyone can send iota tokens to this function and they will automatically be
// divided over the member list. Note that this function does not deal with
// fractions. It simply truncates the calculated amount to the nearest lower
// integer and keeps any remaining iotas in its own account. They will be added
// to any next round of tokens received prior to calculation of the new
// dividend amounts.
func funcDivide(ctx wasmlib.ScFuncContext, f *DivideContext) {
    // Create an ScBalances map proxy to the account balances for this
    // smart contract. Note that ScBalances wraps an ScImmutableMap of
    // token color/amount combinations in a simpler to use interface.
    var balances wasmlib.ScBalances = ctx.Balances()
    
    // Retrieve the amount of plain iota tokens from the account balance
    var amount int64 = balances.Balance(wasmlib.IOTA)
    
    // Retrieve the pre-calculated totalFactor value from the state storage.
    var totalFactor int64 = f.State.TotalFactor().Value()
    
    // Get the proxy to the 'members' map in the state storage.
    var members MapAddressToMutableInt64 = f.State.Members()
    
    // Get the proxy to the 'memberList' array in the state storage.
    var memberList ArrayOfMutableAddress = f.State.MemberList()
    
    // Determine the current length of the memberList array.
    var size int32 = memberList.Length()
    
    // Loop through all indexes of the memberList array.
    for i := int32(0); i < size; i++ {
        // Retrieve the next indexed address from the memberList array.
        var address wasmlib.ScAddress = memberList.GetAddress(i).Value()
        
        // Retrieve the factor associated with the address from the members map.
        var factor int64 = members.GetInt64(address).Value()
        
        // Calculate the fair share of iotas to disperse to this member based on the
        // factor we just retrieved. Note that the result will been truncated.
        var share int64 = amount * factor / totalFactor
        
        // Is there anything to disperse to this member?
        if share > 0 {
            // Yes, so let's set up an ScTransfers map proxy that transfers the
            // calculated amount of iotas. Note that ScTransfers wraps an
            // ScMutableMap of token color/amount combinations in a simpler to use
            // interface. The constructor we use here creates and initializes a
            // single token color transfer in a single statement. The actual color
            // and amount values passed in will be stored in a new map on the host.
            var transfers wasmlib.ScTransfers = wasmlib.NewScTransferIotas(share)
            
            // Perform the actual transfer of tokens from the smart contract to the
            // member address. The transfer_to_address() method receives the address
            // value and the proxy to the new transfers map on the host, and will
            // call the corresponding host sandbox function with these values.
            ctx.TransferToAddress(address, transfers)
        }

In the next section we will introduce function descriptors that can be used to initiate
smart contract functions.
