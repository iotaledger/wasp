# ShimmerEVM Testnet Quickstart Guide

This guide will help you quickly get started with the ShimmerEVM Testnet, where you can deploy and interact with EVM-compatible smart contracts on the Shimmer Testnet.

## Prerequisites

- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) browser extension installed

## Setup MetaMask

<!--
Click this button:

<AddToMetaMaskButton />

or follow these steps: -->

1.  Open MetaMask and click on the network dropdown at the top.
2.  Select "Custom RPC" to add the ShimmerEVM Testnet.
3.  Enter the following information:

    - Network Name: `ShimmerEVM Testnet`
    - New RPC URL: `https://json-rpc.evm.testnet.shimmer.network/`
    - Chain ID: `1071`
    - Currency Symbol: `SMR`
    - Block Explorer URL: `https://explorer.evm.testnet.shimmer.network/`

4.  Click "Save" to add the ShimmerEVM Testnet to MetaMask.

Please read [this MetaMask guide](https://wiki.iota.org/shimmer/smart-contracts/guide/evm/tooling/#metamask) for a detailed guidance.

## Get Testnet SMR Tokens

1.  Go to the [ShimmerEVM Testnet Toolkit](https://evm-toolkit.evm.testnet.shimmer.network/).
2.  Connect your MetaMask wallet by clicking "Connect Wallet" or paste an EVM address.
3.  Select the account you want to receive testnet SMR tokens.
4.  Click "Send funds" to get testnet SMR tokens.

## Get Simulated Bridged Tokens

1. Go to the [ERC20 Simulated Token Faucet](https://evm-faucet.testnet.shimmer.network/).
2. Connect your MetaMask wallet by clicking "Connect Wallet".
3. Select the account you want to receive simulated bridged tokens.
4. Choose the desired token (fETH, fBTC, fUSDT, etc.) from the dropdown list.
5. Click "Submit" to get the selected simulated bridged tokens.

## Deploy and Interact with Smart Contracts

You can now use your testnet SMR tokens and simulated bridged tokens to deploy and interact with smart contracts on the ShimmerEVM Testnet. Utilize popular development tools and frameworks, such as [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/), [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/), or [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/), to build, test, and deploy your smart contracts.

## Explore the ShimmerEVM Testnet

Visit the [ShimmerEVM Testnet Block Explorer](https://explorer.evm.testnet.shimmer.network/) to monitor the chain, track transactions, and explore deployed smart contracts.
