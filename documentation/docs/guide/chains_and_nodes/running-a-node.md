# Running a Node

Due to wasp being desgined as an INX plugin, its necessary to run the wasp node alongside your own hornet node, for this we provide a simple docker-compose setup.

## Setup

Clone and follow the instructions on the [node-docker-setup repo](https://github.com/iotaledger/node-docker-setup).

:::note
This is aimed for prodution-ready deployment, if you're looking to spawn a local node for testing/development, please see: [local-setup](https://github.com/iotaledger/wasp/tree/develop/tools/local-setup)
