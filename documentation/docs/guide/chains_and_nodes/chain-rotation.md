# Chain Rotation

## Get public key of wallet address

The “Chain Owner” is the only entity that can perform administrative tasks. Any Iota/Shimmer Layer1 public key can be used. Whoever owns that key, basically owns the chain. 
In this example we'll be using the keys auto-generated by `wasp-cli init`.  In a consortium it would be wise to use a multisig setup.

Get wallet public key with the command below

```bash
wasp-cli address
```

Copy the public key and pass that to the `--gov-contraller` flag on the `wasp-cli chain deploy` command.

## Start chain

Before starting a chain, all nodes need to trust each other. See [Trust setup](./setting-up-a-chain.md#trust-setup) for instructions on chain peering. Deploy a new chain with the command below

```bash
wasp-cli chain deploy --chain "chain-name" --description "Test Chain"  --evm-chainid 1076
```

## Add access nodes

To introduce new committee nodes, its recommended to add them as access nodes while the previous committee is still in place, so that they can sync the chain state.
If all you want to do is remove existing nodes from the chain then skip this step.

To learn more about adding access nodes see [chain management](./chain-management.md#changing-access-nodes).

## Run DKG

Update your `wasp-cli` config and run the dkg command with the indices for the new committee members

```bash
wasp-cli chain rundkg --peers=foo,bar
```

Copy the new public key

## Rotate chain

```bash
wasp-cli chain rotate ${new_chain_pub_key}
```
