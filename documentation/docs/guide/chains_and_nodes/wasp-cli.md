# Configuring wasp-cli

Step-by-step instructions on how to use wasp-cli to interact with Wasp nodes on the Hornet network.

## Download wasp-cli

Download the latest wasp-cli binary from the repo [relases page](https://github.com/iotaledger/wasp/releases).
(For ease of use, it is recommend to add `wasp-cli` to your system `PATH`).

## Configuration

You can create a basic default configuration by running:

```shell
wasp-cli init 
````

This command will create a configuration file named `wasp-cli.json` in the current directory.

After this, you will need to tell the `wasp-cli` the location of the Hornet node and the committee of Wasp nodes:

```shell
wasp-cli set l1.apiaddress http://localhost:14265
# the faucet only exists for test networks
wasp-cli set l1.faucetaddress http://localhost:8091

# You can add as many nodes as you'd like
wasp-cli wasp add wasp-0 127.0.0.1:9090
wasp-cli wasp add wasp-1 127.0.0.1:9091
```

If you configure the Wasp node to use JWT authentication, you will need to log in
after you save the configuration.

```shell
wasp-cli login
```
