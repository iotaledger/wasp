--------------------------- MODULE WaspChainRecovery ---------------------------
(*
This specification is concerned with a Chain's committee recovery in the case,
when we have more than F nodes failed by crashing and probably loosing the
persistent storage (the SC state still has to be available).

The goal is to define rules for a node to recover and join the committee.
It is complicated to rejoin to the existing consensus instance because of
big number of protocols involved. Here we considering rejoin by proposing
to abandon the existing log entry and proceed to the next one. The approach
can be summarized as:

  - Do not participate in the LI after a restart, if the LogIndex for that consensus
    is the latest recorded in the persistent storage. We probably sent some messages
    in it, so participating after the restart can render us byzantine faulty.

  - Proceed to the next LI, if there is N-F nodes proposing that. Support such
    proposal if there is at least F+1 proposals (TODO: Do we need the F+1 case?).

  - RecoverTimeout is needed to break some cases. E.g. half of nodes are running
    consensus, and other half has restarted and asking for the next LI.

TODO: Consider ConsensusDone from the future LogIndexes.
TODO: Consider events: AOReceived, AORejected.

(*
A non-running node can start up. In this case it has to read its log index
from the persistent store, if any.

NOTE: Here we increase LogIndex, but con't sen the CONS_IN message. This way we
just skip participation in the same consensus instance, we probably participated
before the crash.
