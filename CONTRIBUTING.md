# Contributing

If you want to contribute to this repository, consider posting a [bug report](https://github.com/iotaledger/wasp/issues/new-issue), or a feature request, or a [pull request](https://github.com/iotaledger/wasp/pulls/).

You can talk to us directly on our [Discord server](https://discord.iota.org/) in the `#smartcontracts-dev` channel.

## Creating a Pull Request

Please base your work on the `develop` branch.

Before creating a pull request, ensure all tests pass locally, and the linter reports no violations.

## Running Tests

To run tests locally, Docker is required to be installed and started.

Execute one of the following commands:

```shell
go test -short -tags rocksdb ./...
```

Or, as an alternative:

```shell
make test-short
```

The commands above execute a subset of all available tests. If you introduced major changes, consider running the whole test suite instead, with `make test` or `make test-full` (these can take several minutes, so go and grab a coffee!).

## Running the Linter

### Setup

#### Step 1: Install golintci

See the [provider instructions](https://golangci-lint.run/welcome/install/#local-installation) on how to install golintci.

#### Step 2: Set Up Your Environment

See the [provider instructions](https://golangci-lint.run/welcome/integrations/#editor-integration) on integrating `golintci` into your source code editor. You can also find our [recommended settings](#appendix-recommended-settings) for VS Code and GoLand at the bottom of this article.

### Usage

To run the linter locally, execute:

```shell
golangci-lint run
```

or

```shell
make lint
```

The linter will also automatically run every time you run:

```shell
make
```

### False Positives

You can [disable](https://golangci-lint.run/usage/false-positives/) false positives by placing a special comment directly above the "violating" element:

```go
//nolint
func foobar() *string {
    // ...
}
```

To be sure that the linter will not ignore actual issues in the future, try to suppress only relevant warnings over an element. Also, explain the reason why the `nolint` is needed. E.g.:

```go
//nolint:unused // This is actually used by the xyz tool
func foo() *string {
    // ...
}
```

## Appendix: Recommended Settings

### Visual Studio Code

Adjust your VS Code settings as follows:

```json
// required:
"go.lintTool": "golangci-lint",
// recommended:
"go.lintOnSave": "package"
"go.lintFlags": ["--fix"],
"editor.formatOnSave": true,
```

### GoLand

1. Install the [golintci](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/12496-go-linter) plugin.

2. Configure path for `golangci`.

3. Add a `golangci` file watcher with a custom command. We recommend using it with the `--fix` parameter.
